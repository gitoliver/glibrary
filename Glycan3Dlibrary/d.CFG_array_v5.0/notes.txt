Fixing anotation errors:
Glycans 451 and 376 had annotation errors that I fixed. See email from Rob and Dave dfsmith@emory.edu 


Internal Linkages:
created this folder using clashes_28.cc
scp'd to my own PC as gems compiles there
created internal linkages using the Dropbox script in j.generate2-8InternalTorsions
This removed the original pdb files and replaced them with files containing the permutations of the 2-8 linkages.
I then removed the original pdb_Files folder on shaw and replaced it with the one from my PC.

Fixing annotation errors:
Glycans 509 and 560 have errors. See emails with rmcbride@scripps.edu. 509 has
a missing bracket making an impossible structure. 560 has an alpha man in the core, rather than the beta.
Instead of redoing 28 linkages, I've built 509 and 560 separately and merged
here.
